block scope.
function scope is the same as block scope.
inner function closes over the outer set. It can see all the variables of the outer function
and more.
Inner function survives the outer function
if function a() {
return function b();
}
the caller of function a now has function b, but b has use of any variables in function a


function f(y){
y = null;
}
var x = [];
f(x);
log(x);

ES6 added the ability to do this:
function(...x,y){
    return x;
}
