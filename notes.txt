block scope.
function scope is the same as block scope.
inner function closes over the outer set. It can see all the variables of the outer function
and more.
Inner function survives the outer function
if function a() {
return function b();
}
the caller of function a now has function b, but has access to any variables in function a


function f(y){
y = null;
}
var x = [];
f(x);
log(x);

javascript does not update by reference. You pass in global variables, if you don't return then won't do anything

kyle simpson "You don't know js"

4 ways of doing it: 

inc = addf(1);
inc = curry(add,1);
inc = curryr(add,1);
inc = liftf(add)(1);

ES6 added the ability to do this:
function(...x,y){
    return x;
}
